## ITSECWB Milestone Website Group Project

This repository contains the ITSECWB website group project for **Milestones 1 and 2**.
The project is based on a previous work from https://github.com/Yoshiii04/ITDBADM5.

The website presents a range of computer peripherals and accessories designed to accommodate different budgets and user needs. It also outlines available after-sales services, including troubleshooting and repair support. Products are presented starting from a base offering, with options to expand through additional components or upgrades as required.
