## ITSECWB Milestone Website Group Project

This repository contains the ITSECWB website group project for **Milestones 1 and 2**.
The project is based on a previous work from https://github.com/Yoshiii04/ITDBADM5.

The website presents a range of computer peripherals and accessories designed to accommodate different budgets and user needs. 

It has been simplified to accommodate the scope of a security web development course, focusing on the implementation of secure login and registration systems, authentication mechanisms, and basic user access control.
